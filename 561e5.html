Are you a marketer? A programmer? A designer? A sales guy? Whoever you may be, this article is for you. Mostly because you are human. And the Git workflow is for humans. Let's not talk about the not-so-intuitive Git commands for now. There are many tools and resources to make that a cakewalk for you. <br /> <br />

It's perhaps hypocrisy of the highest degree to talk about the Git workflow without exposing the reader to how the article evolved, how it branched from something it was to what it finally came out to be. <br /><br />

And if the goal of the article is to convince people to adopt the Git workflow for all data requirements of a general problem statement, be it code, text, excel sheets, images, word docs, whatever, I believe its almost a crime to not adopt the Git workflow for the article.
You can see all versions of this article. Right now, well, there aren't any, but there will be and when there are, you can just click on the commits I made while writing this article and see how it evolved to whatever it evolves to. <br /><br />

I have been reading up extensively about Git for almost two months now. I have elaborate notes from the ProGit book (which is amazing by the way) and I have gone through all the blogs I could find that talk about how awesome Git is and others that talk about what Git doesn't do well enough. <br /><br />
That, I think is a matter of opinion. <br />
Programmers love Git because they understand the architecture, the sheer elegance of it. <br />
Designers think in terms of abstractions, some that Git does brilliantly, others that it fails at doing. (Merge-conflicts etc.) Great design doesn't even make its presence felt and stuff like that. <br /><br />

So, instead of talking about Git, I will talk about the Git workflow, the ideology behind it, which I found no critics for. <br /><br />

The first part of the Git ideology is that of version control. <br />
We, as humans, make mistakes. We don't always know what we are doing and so, we try a few things out, see the results and adjust ourselves accordingly. In Git terms, you try things out in "branches" and you remember what you are doing using a "commit". <br />
The second part is that of a distributed system. <br />
It basically implies letting everybody see the bigger picture. As Clay Shirky pointed out in his TED talk, this ideology reflects democratic spirit. In Git terms, you "push" to share your changes with everybody else and you "pull" to accept others' changes, from a host all parties have access to. <br /><br />

When you put these two ideologies together, you get a potent way of working as a human, with humans. Now let's take a real situation and see if the Git workflow can help us out.<br /><br />

If you are working for a technology company, chances are, the landmarks of your company's growth will be marked by the features and interface you add to your offering. <br /><br />

Let's say your company is introducing a new feature. You have got a designer in place, pushing out all the creative work for you, to publicize the new feature. You have got some sources set up to gather all the stats to judge if your new feature is well received. If your programmers use the Git workflow, they almost certainly must have created a "branch" for this new feature.
Let's take a step back for a moment now. The programmers appear to be adapting to the situation better than everybody else. Is branch just a coding thing? Certainly not. Your company's future relies on it. Shouldn't your entire company data "branch" out? So that all you have to do to find out if the branch worked is switch to it and that's all. The stats, design work, documentation and code, all in one place. If you are worried about privacy, that's not really the point. You could create separate repositories for your different teams. The point is, Git supports the natural way of working. <br /><br />

The stats always follow a linear flow because they rely on external factors. So it doesn't quite make sense to use the word "branch" for it. Reality always follows just one path. But they could certainly use the tags to remember where something different was done. Everything makes sense for designers though. <br /><br />
