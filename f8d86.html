Are you a marketer? A programmer? A designer? A sales guy? Whoever you may be, this article is for you. Mostly because you are human. And the Git workflow is for humans. Let's not talk about the not-so-intuitive Git commands for now. There are many tools and resources to make that a cakewalk for you.<br /><br />

It's perhaps hypocrisy of the highest degree to talk about the Git workflow without exposing the reader to how the article evolved, how it branched from something it was to what it finally came out to be.<br /><br />

And if the goal of the article is to convince people to adopt the Git workflow for all data requirements of a general problem statement, be it code, text, excel sheets, images, word docs, whatever, I believe its almost a crime to not adopt the Git workflow for the article.
You can see all versions of this article. <br />
Right now, well, there aren't any, but there will be and when there are, you can just click on the commits I made while writing this article and see how it evolved to whatever it evolves to.
<br /><br />
I have been reading up extensively about Git for almost two months now. I have elaborate notes from the ProGit book (which is amazing by the way) and I have gone through all the blogs I could find that talk about how awesome Git is and others that talk about what Git doesn't do well enough. <br />
That, I think is a matter of opinion. <br />
Programmers love Git because they understand the architecture, the sheer elegance of it. 
<br />
Designers think in terms of abstractions, some that Git does brilliantly, others that it fails to do. (Merge-conflicts etc.) Great design doesn't make its presence felt and stuff like that.
<br /><br />
But, there was this particular comment, I fail to recollect the source of, that got me thinking more about Git. 
<br /><br />
"Where's the iphone of version control systems?", asked the commenter. 
<br /><br />
That's a very good question. Git to version control systems is not what iphone was to phones. Or is it? <br />
The answer lies in answering an even more fundamental question. <br /><br />

Do people need an iphone of VCS?<br /><br />

If the fate of Git lies only in the hands of programmers, probably not. If there is something for everyone in the Git workflow, then a big yes. <br /><br />

So now, I get to the point. Is there something for everyone in the Git workflow?  <br /><br />

As Clay Shirky pointed out in his TED talk, the git ideology reflects democratic spirit. The idea that everybody has all of the resource at all times and yet can't misuse it, is indeed attractive. <br /><br />

If I were to start a company knowing the power of the Git workflow, I would make six repos- one for all the code, one for all the designs and graphics work, one for all the product related documentation, another for all the business related documentation, one for all the stats documents and the last for all of our discussions. <br /><br />

I don't really know if that would be a great idea but it's definitely worth a shot. All I have to do when someone new joins in is add him/her as a collaborator and he would understand the company as much as I want him to. Hired a freelancer? Well, working remotely couldn't be easier. The workflow lets you work offline with the tools you are most comfortable with and yet, lets you stay in sync with everybody else. <br /><br />

So now that we agree that the Git workflow can help non programmers too, we ask ourselves, can Git pull it off? Can Git usher the world into a new era of collaboration? Like Clay Shirky described it, the era of collaboration without coordination. <br /><br /><br />

I will leave the question open to discussions before making any judgement but one thing I am pretty sure about is that the answer to this question can change your, yes dear reader, your life.
