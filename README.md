<h2>An article on Git, using Git. </h2><br />
I had been making commits and branches the whole time, so you can see all versions of the article using the interface I have added. 
Clone the repo and host the code on an Apache server or whatever to run it.
Whole heartedly open to pull requests and comments. Thanks!
